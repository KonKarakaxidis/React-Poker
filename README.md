## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run server`

Starts the server.
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to get the app from the server.
To play you need to open two browser tabs and navigate to http://localhost:8000.
Hit 'Start' and create a poker room by pressing the cross icon. 
After the room is created, click on the room name to navigate to the table.
Join the same room from the other browser tab in order to play a game.

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
